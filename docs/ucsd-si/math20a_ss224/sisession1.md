# SI Session 1

Welcome to Session 1! We'll be going over some material from precalculus that will be useful for this class. 

## Exponentials

The following properties are true if $a$ is a positive real number and $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.
1. $a^{(x+y)} = a^xa^y$
2. $a^{(x-y)} = \frac{a^x}{a^y}$
3. $(a^x)^y = a^{xy}$
4. $a^0 = 1$
5. $(ab)^x = a^xb^x$
6. $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^x = \frac{a^x}{b^x}$

## Logarithms

Let both $x$ and $a$ be positive real numbers. Also, suppose that $a \neq 1$. Then, we can define $y = \log_ax$ such that $a^y = x$). We call $a$ the **base** of the logarithm and $x$ the **argument** of the logarithm. Furthermore, we also often write that $\log_ex = \ln x$, and $\ln x$ is called the **natural logarithm** of $x$.

Here are some nice properties of logarithms, which hold when $a$, $x$, $y$, and $b$ are positive real numbers:
1. $\log_a(xy) = \log_a(x) + log_a(y)$
2. $\log_a\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_a(x) - log_a(y)$
3. $\log_a x^r = r\log_a(x)$
4. $\log_a 1 = 0$
5. $\log_a\left(a^x\right) = x$
6. $a^{\log_a x} = x$
7. $log_a x = \frac{log_b x}{log_b a}$

The last rule is often called the change of base rule.

## Trig Functions


## Questions to Think About
1. How can we derive the change of base rule? Hint: consider the expression $log_a x = y$, which implies that $ x = a^y$.
